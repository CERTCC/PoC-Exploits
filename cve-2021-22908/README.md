# cve-2021-22908

This python3 script checks for Pulse Connect Secure servers vulnerable to
[VU#667933](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/667933) CVE-2021-22908. The python requests library is required for operation.

## Usage modes:  
`cve-2021-22908.py <host>`  
This mode will interactively log in to a PCS server to obtain a DSID value.

`cve-2021-22908.py <host> -d <DSID>`  
In the case were a PCS user's DSID is already known, this mode will skip the
interactive login exchange.

`cve-2021-22908.py <host> -n`  
If you do not have authentication available for the target PCS, you can check
for only the presence of the Workaround-2105.xml mitigation.


## Results:  
`HTTP 500`  
This is indicative of a vulnerable PCS server, due to a crashing CGI.

`HTTP 403.  XML workaround applied`  
This is indicative of a PCS server that has an XML mitigation applied.

`HTTP 200.  Windows File Access Policies prevents exploitation.`  
This is indicative of a PCS server that has "Windows File Access Policies"
configured in a way that prevents exploitation.

`HTTP %s.  Not vulnerable.`  
The PCS server does not appear to be vulnerable.
