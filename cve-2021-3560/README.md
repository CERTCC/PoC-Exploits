# cve-2021-3560

## Vulnerability Info
https://github.blog/2021-06-10-privilege-escalation-polkit-root-on-linux-with-bug/

## PackageKit Exploit
### Installing Packages
`install.py` can be used to install a package (such as gnome-control-center) bypassing authentication on systems vulnerable to CVE-2021-3560

The package ID will need to include the semicolons so the quotations are necessary. To determine a valid package id, use the included `search.py` script

On tested systems, simply running the python script results in the process being killed at the correct timing. If needed, you can add a 'time.sleep()' to the end of the script and the sleep & kill technique can be used for better timing.
### Usage
`python3 install.py 'full;package;id;here'`


### Searching For Package IDs
`search.py` is used to determine a full package id from a simple package name.

### Usage
`python3 search.py package_name(s)`
